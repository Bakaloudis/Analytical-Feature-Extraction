# Analytical-Feature-Extraction-on-Breast-Cancer-data
In this brief project, i conduct an extented analysis on breast cancer data.
(data provided by https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). 
I analyze the correlation between the features to extract the most valuable out of them. I train 10 machine learning models (using scikit-learn) with the initial features and then train the same models with the extracted features to show the effectivesness of the feature selection methods used.
