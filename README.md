# Analytical-Feature-Extraction
In this brief project, i conduct an extented analysis on breast cancer data (data provided by https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). I analyze the correlation between the features to extract the most valuable out of them. I train 10 models with the initial features and then train the same models with the extracted features to show the effectivesness of the feature selection methods used.
